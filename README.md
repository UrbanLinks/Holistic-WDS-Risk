**HOLISTIC ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL, ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF PIPE BREAKS: A CASE STUDY OF VANCOUVER**


# Overview

This study presents a holistic assessment framework for water pipe break impacts in Vancouver, Canada. It assesses social, environmental, and economic vulnerabilities as a consequence of failure (COF), combining them with the probabilities of failure (POF) is evaluated by a Weibull model. Combining these criteria prioritizes pipe replacement and rehabilitationÂ to mitigate the adverse impacts of infrastructure failure.


- This repository contains the codes and data used for the research project. 

- The codes was developed using **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and visualization.
